# RedditTopPosts
Prints Reddit's front page titles and their respective authors. Currently, it only works when one is logged OUT of reddit.

# User's Manual:
In order for this to work, you will need a means to run Python, as well as the packages imported in the .py file provided. To use it, one must be logged out of reddit (for html source code reasons), and it should work with efficiency.

*The posts are not currently listed in order.
# OPEN TO CONTRIBUTORS, AS LONG AS THE PULL REQUESTS HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL FEATURE TO OFFER.
